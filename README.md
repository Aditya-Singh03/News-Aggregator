Central repository for Agora - News Aggregator Platform

A web application that provides users with news posts based on their preferences.

Users will select various preferences upon creating an account and can adjust their
preferences as they wish.

The application will then fetch news articles from our news database and display them on the main page in a post format with each post having a description of the article, a link to the article, and certain statistics about the article (read time, sentiment, etc).
The user will also have the option to click on each post to get a more detailed view of the post as well as interact with the comment and like features for each post. These metrics will also be taken into account when recommending news posts to the user in
the future.
